app to pick from a list of recipes to meal plan for the week
request to set plan for week picks n numbre of recipes and sets one for each day, giving user option to amend

user can log in and it will show different schedule to each user. 

recipes to have list of ingredients which can be aggregated to shopping list
each recipe comes with a list of ingrediants with a seperate list of amounts needed that can be aggegated (so rice 50g rwice can be a rice 100g in shopping list)
shopping list to be emailed to each user

deployed via k8s and docker or local


create schedule needs to be able to set week 1 or 2 (week 1 default) on create weekly schedule and pass that onto:
finalise schedule (display which schedule you are working on) pass that onto:
amend shopping list (show which schedule)
show schedule to allow to view both schedules
create show shopping list page, allow amending ingredients and emailing

redefine objects as using @dataclass decorator to make everything more explicit.

do a lot of this in js once I work out how to use react.
